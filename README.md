**Stack using 2 Queues - Linked list implementation**

This program demonstrates how to implement a stack data structure using two queues.  
Both queues are implemented using linked lists to manage data efficiently. The stack operations are carried out by manipulating the queues in a way that emulates the behavior of a stack.
